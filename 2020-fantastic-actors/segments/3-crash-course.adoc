[NOTE]

Actor is a self-contained *object* that can receive *messages* and *act* upon them.

== Crash course: What's an actor?

Actors are usually used to model what's commonly known as the _service layer_, e.g.:

[source,rust]
----
fn main() {
    let mut mw = Microwave::new();

    mw.put("popcorn-kernels");
    mw.put("iphone");
    mw.start(Duration::from_secs(60));
}
----

[source,rust]
----
fn main() {
    let mut mw = MicrowaveOperator::new();

    mw.slip_note("please put these `popcorn-kernels` inside");
    mw.slip_note("please put this `iphone` inside");
    mw.slip_note("please wave micros for 60 seconds");
}

== Crash course: How can we model an actor in Rust?

Since we don't have any power over actor's control flow, how can we let it know we need its service?
