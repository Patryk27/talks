Actor model originated in *1973* and lots of things have happened since then.

There are comprehensive actor frameworks (like *Akka*) that solve practically all of those issues - Rust, though, still
has a long journey ahead of it.

We have a few crates to select from - namely: *Actix*, *Bastion* or *Riker* - but for now they aren't nearly as half as
complete as the ones known in other languages.

*Code bloat*, increased *complexity* or overzealous *Arc-ing* are some of the obvious issues that may arise, but let's
focus on a different aspect - a more language-agnostic one.
