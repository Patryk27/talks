# database-1

A tiny-micro key-value database with very vigorously hard-coded stuff.

## Running

```bash
$ cargo run
```

Since this is meant to be an example of how channels and actors work in general, this application does literally nothing
more than just print a few strings onto the standard output to prove that `see, i told you - it works!`.

If you want to see something in action, please take a look into the `../rustycabs` directory.
