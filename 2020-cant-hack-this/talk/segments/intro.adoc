While objectively you could say my memory isn't that great, one of the things I _do_ recall vividly from my not-that-far
childhood is a toy called, loosely translating, `the secrets of electronics`.

Basically, it was an electronic science kit.

Though this very photo is from a newer set, it more or less resembles the version I used to play with too; you had a
bunch of various modules (like fm radio receiver and sound amplifier) you could stitch together to end up with a radio
or whatever. There was a small electronic motor, some buttons, and diodes, stuff like that.

As it is with toys, this one, too, was a rather addictive one; its manual listed tons of stuff you could build, but -
obviously - one was bounded only by their imagination.

So having completed almost every construction from the manual (think: sirens, radios, dangerous flying propellers), I've
started to include parts _from outside_ the main set - just some random electronic stuff I saw lying around the room that
seemed pretty much useless for me just a few days before.

This toy introduced me into an entirely new, fascinating, and frankly a bit intimidating world of electronics; and
despite the fact that I've eventually become neither Turing with my own Bombe, nor Babbage with my own Analytical
Engine, and generally switched to programming, I've learned a lot on the way - partially thanks to this toy I wasn't
that much afraid of fiddling with Arduino, my first Atmegas, Omega2 or Raspberry Pi a few years later.

== Nix(OS)

I wanted to start with this kind of a cheesy preamble, because - for me - learning and trying Nix was - and to some
degree still remains - such a new, fascinating, and intimidating adventure.

There's this word - epiphany - that means `a moment when you suddenly feel that you understand`, and I'm having that a
lot with Nix, preceded with moments of frustration.

Its unorthodox approach to managing packages and, in case of NixOS, managing the entire system's configuration, is
spine-chilling at first, but rewarding as you get to know Nix better.

So far I've been a NixOS user for about four months, and - though I'm not backed-up with any statistics for that -
having switched from Ubuntu, I feel like my hair can finally grow faster than I'm tearing it out. Although I'm
obviously well-aware that it's not the case for everyone.
