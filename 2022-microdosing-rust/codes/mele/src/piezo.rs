    /// Playing the note requires generating a certain wave - in our case, we're
    /// generating a square wave using AVR's Timer2's PWM facility.
    ///
    /// So what happens here is that we:
    ///
    /// - take the frequency (e.g. 567 Hz),
    ///
    /// - count how many iterations the AVR timer has to tick to count _up to_
    ///   that frequency (e.g. 16 MHz / 567 Hz / 256ยน ~= 110),
    ///
    /// - setup the timer for that value and tell it to "count down to zero and
    ///   after you do, please toggle this pin and start over",
    ///
    /// - wait for `duration` milliseconds (while the timer toggles the pin
    ///   up/down/up/down in the background automatically),
    ///
    /// - shut the timer down.
    ///
    /// Overall, that's a relatively popular method of generating square waves
    /// on AVRs, so feel free to Google for `avr generate sound` to get a better
    /// explanation.
    ///
    /// ยน that's the timer's prescaler - in our case, to get better sound, it's
    ///   not hard-coded to 256 but rather computed automatically
