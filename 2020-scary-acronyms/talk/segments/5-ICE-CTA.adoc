What do you think the compiler will say about this code?

[source,rust]

fn main() {
    break rust;
}

== ICE CTA

Yes, `rustc` has easter eggs:

== ICE CTA

And, yes, `rustc` has bugs too:

*ICE*: internal compiler error

== My _iced-tea_ for you

Try contributing to `rustc`, `cargo`, `rustfmt` or any other project you find useful - all of them could use a little
bit more love!

Bonus points for fixing an actual ICE in the compiler, but really: even a single, small commit can improve your (or
someone else's!) workflow and make (your or someone else's) life better.
