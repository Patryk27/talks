To understand OIBITs, let's see them at work.

== OIBITs

Let's create our very-own struct:

[source,rust]
----
struct StrWrapper(&'static str);
----

== OIBITs

Now, let's create a variable holding an instance of it:

[source,rust]
----
struct StrWrapper(&'static str);

fn main() {
    let text = StrWrapper(
        "c-rustacean is a rust programmer who likes c better"
    );
}
----

== OIBITs

And, just for the kicks, let's send it into another thread:

[source,rust]
----
struct StrWrapper(&'static str);

fn main() {
    let text = StrWrapper(
        "c-rustacean is a rust programmer who likes c better"
    );

    std::thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("{}", text.0);
    }).join().unwrap();
}
----

== OIBITs

So, why does this code compile?

== OIBITs

Not all values can be safely sent across thread boundaries - for instance we can't send `Rc`, because it's not
thread-safe:

[source,rust]
----
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let num = Rc::new(123);

    std::thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("{}", num);
    }).join().unwrap();
}
----

== OIBITs

[listing]
----
error[E0277]: `Rc<i32>` cannot be sent between threads safely
    |
    |       thread::spawn(move || {
    |  _____^^^^^^^^^^^^^_-
    | |     |
    | |     `Rc<i32>` cannot be sent between threads safely
    | |         println!("{}", num);
    | |     });
    | |_____- within this `[closure]`
----

== OIBITs

[source,rust]
----
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let num = Rc::new(123);
    let mut num2 = Rc::clone(&num);

    std::thread::spawn(move || {
        // err: race read
        println!("{}", num);
    }).join().unwrap();

    // err: race write
    *Rc::get_mut(&mut num2).unwrap() += 1;
}
----

== OIBITs

To distinguish between values (types) that can be sent across thread boundaries, and those which can't, Rust uses the
`Send` trait.

== OIBITs

To distinguish between values (types) that can be sent across thread boundaries, and those which can't, Rust uses the
`Send` trait.

In other words: only when a type implements `Send`, can it be safely transferred into another thread.

== OIBITs

We can confirm this by inspecting the definition of `std::thread::spawn()`:

[source,rust]
----
pub fn spawn<F, T>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<T>
where
    F: FnOnce() -> T,
    F: Send + 'static,
    T: Send + 'static,
----

[.compact]
== OIBITs

Going back to my original question:

Why does this code compile, if we don't have `impl Send for StrWrapper { }` anywhere?

[source,rust]
----
struct StrWrapper(&'static str);

fn main() {
    let text = StrWrapper(
        "c-rustacean is a rust programmer who likes c better"
    );

    std::thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("{}", text.0);
    }).join().unwrap();
}

There are two vital things you have to know about opt-in built-in traits:

- *they aren't opt-in* (mostly),
- *they aren't built-in* (mostly).

The feature was later renamed into *auto traits*, so from this point forward we're going to stick to the new
terminology.

== Auto traits

When you have a regular trait, you have to implement it yourself (`opt-in`):

[source,rust]
----
struct StrWrapper(&'static str);

impl fmt::Display for StrWrapper {
    /* ... */
}
----

== Auto traits

On the other hand, *auto traits* are implemented for you _automatically_, unless you explicitly `opt-out` of them:

[source,rust]
----
struct StrWrapper(&'static str);

impl !Send for StrWrapper { }
//   ^ notice the exclamation mark
----

== Auto traits

[source,rust]
----
struct StrWrapper(&'static str);

impl !Send for StrWrapper { } // here

fn main() {
    let text = StrWrapper(
        "c-rustacean is a rust programmer who likes c better"
    );

    std::thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("{}", text.0);
    }).join().unwrap();
}
----

== Auto traits

[listing]
----
error[E0277]: `StrWrapper` cannot be sent between threads safely
    |
    |       std::thread::spawn(move || {
    |  _____^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^_-
    | |     |
    | |     `StrWrapper` cannot be sent between threads safely
    | |         println!("{}", text.0);
    | |     }).join().unwrap();
    | |_____- within this `[closure]`
----

== Auto traits

Generally, the rule is:

Type `T` automatically implements auto trait `X` when *all* fields of that type implement `X` too.

[.compact]
== Auto traits

[source,rust]
----
pub struct Word {
    word: String,
    synonyms: Vec<String>,
    antonyms: Vec<String>,
}

fn assert_is_send<T: Send>() { }

fn main() {
    assert_is_send::<Word>();
}
----

Since:

- `String` already implements `Send`,
- `Vec<T>` implements `Send` when `T` does,

\... compiler automatically deducts that it's safe to `impl Send` for this struct too.

[.compact]
== Auto traits

[source,rust]
----
pub struct Word {
    word: String,
    synonyms: Vec<Rc<String>>, // here
    antonyms: Vec<String>,
}

fn assert_is_send<T: Send>() { }

fn main() {
    assert_is_send::<Word>();
           // error: ^^^^ `Word` cannot be sent between
           //             threads safely
}
----

Since `Rc` implements `!Send`, compiler automatically deducts that our `Word` is `!Send` too.

== Auto traits

[source,rust]
----
use std::ffi::c_void;

pub struct EnterpriseFizzBuzzFfiWrapper {
    java_handler_object_facade: *const c_void,
}

fn assert_is_send<T: Send>() { }

fn main() {
    assert_is_send::<EnterpriseFizzBuzzFfiWrapper>();
           // error: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
}
----

== Auto traits

`Send` isn't magic - it's defined in the standard library:

[source,rust]
----
pub unsafe auto trait Send {
    // empty.
}

impl<T: ?Sized> !Send for *const T {}
impl<T: ?Sized> !Send for *mut T {}
impl<T: ?Sized> !Send for Rc<T> {}
// ... and many more
----

== Auto traits

No one prevents you from creating your own auto traits:

[source,rust]
----
auto trait Friend { }

impl !Friend for String { }

fn ensure_friend<T: Friend>() { }

fn main() {
    ensure_friend::<&str>();
    ensure_friend::<String>();
          // error: ^^^^^^ the trait `Friend` is not
          //               implemented for
          //               `std::string::String`
}
